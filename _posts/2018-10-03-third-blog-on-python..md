    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When things got tough (level 14/14) I didn't freak out instead I tried to see it differently and if I was still stuck I would ask my partner for help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I thought about why certain things had to be certain ways to get the results needed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Unless I needed help or someone else needed helped I worked independently and got quite a lot done.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think next time I should be more open-minded about new commands and just get on with it rather than complain about how it is making it tricky for me on purpose.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I am gradually growing to like this style of coding and that helps with engagement and quality of work.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to crack on and tell myself that people use this to code so many things and they try out new things and a lot worse things will happen to them if they make a mistake and they don't have Instructions on how to do every stage unlike what I have.</td>
